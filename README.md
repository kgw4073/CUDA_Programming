These files are to optimize some nuisance loops in multiplying two very big sized matrices.
You have to understand the CUDA concept that GPU uses multi-threads when calculating very big but simple operations.
If you compile and run the codes, then you can check which programming method is faster than the other (CPU vs GPU).
